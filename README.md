IdeaGrid
==========

Note: This project is a work in progress to showcase the power of Padrino.

Overview
-------------

I would like to build this out slowly but surely. Basically this will be a port of the existing (but incomplete) website at [IdeaGrid](http://ideagrid.org). The basic structure is as follows:

* Users can post problems that exist in the world.
* For each problem, users can propose solutions to these problems.
* Users can vote on proposed solutions and the top ones will become projects.
* For each project, users can add tasks to help work towards the project.
* For each task, user can set parameters such as "frequency", "people needed", "type"
* Users can then accept a task and help contribute towards the project's completion

Checkout [IdeaGrid](http://ideagrid.org) for an incomplete execution of this idea. I want to port the existing functionality (creating problems, projects and tasks) over to this new application.

Description
-----------

A port of a cool idea by George Ruan. Basically a huge site for solving the world's problems through working together over the web.

Ideagrid is a community of diverse individuals with the common goal of improving the environment through communication, planning, and cooperation.

An innovative community collaborating to provide solutions to local and global issues. 

 * Incorporate your concerns of current events in the Problems tab. 
 * Demonstrate your methods or solutions in the Idea tab. 
 * Execute your plans of improving the world in the Tasks tab. 
 * Arrange events with interested members in the People tab.

Whether you change to using energy efficient light-bulbs or switch to a more fuel efficient car, your contributing to creating a greener environment.
